## Our roulette strategy tester
The strategy: 
You bet on a color and everytime you lose you double your betting (so if you lose with 1 you go 2 then 4 and so on)

If you win, you quit immediatly and leave the table.

You'll only win the amount that you bet initially.

The code is in `main.ts` and typescript compiles it to `main.js`
